                   <h1>Wsp topstone1 Website Re-Design</h1> 
                   <h2>Boston-Jamal Boothe</h2>
                   <div id="Site">
                   <h3>Site Intent</h3>
                   
                   <h4>Project Analysis Overview</h4>		                                                             
                        <p>Topstone1.com is to specialize in custom orders for marble stone appliances and water fountains as fast as possible. These are the areas that I feel must be fixed to redesign this site.</p>
                    <h4>W3C Validation Errors</h4>
                    <p>Topstone1 does not pass the W3C as it consists of 99 errors and 2 warnings on the html while the CSS side is non-existent. That alone gives it a good reason to redesign this site. The majority of these errors come from the site using inline styles that are not being called properly resulting in images being displayed slowly or random links suddenly working as you work your way into this site. This will be fixed by removing inline styles inputting a style sheet to not only clean up the markup, but to also make this site look presentable.</p>
                    <h4>Layout</h4>
                    <p>Topstone1.com definitely needs an overhaul on their layout. I personally think a rule of three thirds will fit this site perfectly seeing as this is a site providing services. My take on this website is to have the main content showcasing the top 5 products of the website and having other information such as the contact information as the footer. There is also no escape hatch whatsoever so it is easy to get lost on this website. There is also moveable text that I personally believe throws off the site and leaves the main content (if there is one) unnoticeable. You look at this website and the first thing you think is what do I look at first. This will be achieved by having a proper navigation. There will also be an escape hatch to let the user know how to navigate throughout the website with a conscience of knowing how to get back to familiar territory. Footer will have the necessary data (address, contact information) at the bottom instead of being at the top left.</p>
